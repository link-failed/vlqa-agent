**Question:** For credit transactions, what would be the average fee that the card scheme GlobalCard would charge for a transaction value of 10 EUR?

**Guidelines:** Answer must be just a number expressed in EUR rounded to 6 decimals. If a question does not have a relevant or applicable answer for the task, please respond with 'Not Applicable'.

**Code:**
```py
import json
import os

# Load fees data
fees_file = os.path.join('.', 'test_case', 'dabstep_data', 'fees.json')

with open(fees_file, 'r') as f:
    fees = json.load(f)

# Filter for GlobalCard credit transactions
globalcard_credit_fees = [
    fee for fee in fees
    if (fee.get('card_scheme') in [None, "GlobalCard"]) \
       and (fee.get('is_credit') is None or fee.get('is_credit'))
]

if not globalcard_credit_fees:
    answer = 'Not Applicable'
else:
    transaction_amount = 10.0
    total_fee = sum(
        fee.get('fixed_amount', 0) + (fee.get('rate', 0) / 10000) * transaction_amount
        for fee in globalcard_credit_fees
    )
    
    average_fee = total_fee / len(globalcard_credit_fees)
    answer = round(average_fee, 6)

final_answer(answer)
