**Question:** In January 2023 what delta would Belles_cookbook_store pay if the relative fee of the fee with ID=384 changed to 1?

**Guidelines:** Answer must be just a number rounded to 14 decimals. If a question does not have a relevant or applicable answer for the task, please respond with 'Not Applicable'.

**Code:**
```py
import json
import csv

# Load fees data from the JSON file
with open('./test_case/dabstep_data/fees.json', 'r') as f:
    fees_data = json.load(f)

# Find the fee with ID 384
fee_384 = next((fee for fee in fees_data if fee['ID'] == 384), None)

if not fee_384:
    final_answer("Not Applicable")
else:
    card_scheme = fee_384['card_scheme']
    is_credit = 'TRUE' if fee_384['is_credit'] else ('FALSE' if fee_384['is_credit'] is False else None)
    aci_list = fee_384['aci']
    intracountry = fee_384['intracountry']
    account_type_list = fee_384['account_type']

    # Filter transactions applying fee 384's conditions
    with open('./test_case/dabstep_data/payments.csv', 'r') as csvfile:
        reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
        january_transactions = [
            float(row['eur_amount']) for row in reader
            if row['merchant'] == 'Belles_cookbook_store' and int(row['year']) == 2023
            and row['day_of_year'].isdigit() and int(row['day_of_year']) <= 31
            and row['card_scheme'] == card_scheme
            and (is_credit is None or row['is_credit'] == is_credit)
            and (aci_list == [] or row['aci'] in aci_list)
            and (intracountry is None or float(row['issuing_country'] == row['acquirer_country']) == intracountry)
            and (account_type_list == [] or row['account_type'] in account_type_list)
        ]

    transaction_value = sum(january_transactions)

    # Current fee calculation: fee = fixed_amount + rate * transaction_value / 10000
    current_fee = (fee_384['rate'] / 10000) * transaction_value + fee_384['fixed_amount'] * len(january_transactions)

    # New fee with rate changed to 1
    new_rate = 1
    new_fee = (new_rate / 10000) * transaction_value + fee_384['fixed_amount'] * len(january_transactions)

    delta = new_fee - current_fee
    answer = round(delta, 14)
    
    final_answer(answer)
```
