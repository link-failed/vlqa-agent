**Question:** For account type H and the MCC description: Eating Places and Restaurants, what would be the average fee that the card scheme GlobalCard would charge for a transaction value of 10 EUR? Provide the answer in EUR and 6 decimals.

**Guidelines:** Answer must be just a number expressed in EUR rounded to 6 decimals. If a question does not have a relevant or applicable answer for the task, please respond with 'Not Applicable'.

**Code:**
```py
import json
import csv

# Load fees data
with open('./test_case/dabstep_data/fees.json', 'r') as f:
    fees_data = json.load(f)

# Load merchant category codes
with open('./test_case/dabstep_data/merchant_category_codes.csv', 'r') as f:
    mcc_reader = csv.DictReader(f)
    mcc_map = {row['mcc']: row['description'] for row in mcc_reader}
    
# Filter MCC for Eating Places and Restaurants
eating_places_mcc = [mcc for mcc, desc in mcc_map.items() if desc == "Eating Places and Restaurants"]

# Filter fees for GlobalCard, account type H, and relevant MCC, considering null values and lists for all fields
relevant_fees = [
    fee for fee in fees_data
    if (fee['card_scheme'] == "" or fee['card_scheme'] == 'GlobalCard') and (
        fee['account_type'] == [] or 'H' in fee['account_type']
    ) and (
        fee['merchant_category_code'] == [] or any(mcc in fee['merchant_category_code'] for mcc in map(int, eating_places_mcc))
    )
]

if not relevant_fees:
    final_answer("Not Applicable")
else:
    # Calculate fees for a transaction value of 10 EUR
    transaction_value = 10
    fees = []
    for fee in relevant_fees:
        fixed_fee = fee['fixed_amount']
        rate_fee = (fee['rate'] / 10000) * transaction_value
        total_fee = fixed_fee + rate_fee
        fees.append(total_fee)
    
    if not fees:
        answer = "Not Applicable"
    else:
        average_fee = sum(fees) / len(fees)
        answer = round(average_fee, 6)
    
    final_answer(answer)
